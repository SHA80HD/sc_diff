# Viewing Diffs
GitHub limits diff sizes on the website. You have to use an external application to view the full diff.

The different realms are split into individual branches.

## GitHub Desktop
You can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to view the differences between patches.

## WinMerge
[WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/?lang=en) is great also but requires you to download two sets of data.

# How To Extract Files Yourself

## unp4k

1. Download and unzip: [unp4k](https://github.com/dolkensp/unp4k/releases/tag/v3.13.21)
2. From a command prompt: `unp4k.exe "c:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE\data.p4k" *.xml`
    - If you want all files AND assets, remove `*.xml`. This takes much longer to unpack and unforge.
    - Switch LIVE to PTU or EPTU to unpack those realms.
    - Create separate folders for different builds if you want to diff them later.
3. From a command prompt: `unforge.exe Data`
4. From a command prompt: `unforge.exe Engine`
5. View files with text editor of your choice.
    - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - [WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/?lang=en)

## Starfab (Highly Recommended)

1. Download and install [Starfab](https://gitlab.com/scmodding/tools/starfab/-/releases)
2. Run it
